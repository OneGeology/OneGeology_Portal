Example Cesium Globe portal 

Web applications require web servers, and CesiumJS is no different. To keep things simple, this tutorial skips the local server setup and uses Glitch, an online IDE for web development. Create a new Glitch project by clicking here. Once Glitch loads, ignore the template instructions and instead click on index.html, delete the entire contents, and replace it with the code above.

Click the Show/Live button and it will open a new window with your Cesium app in action. This view will automatically be updated as you modify the code.
